<h1>Eisenhower ToDo Management</h1>
<p class="fs-4">This application helps you to manage your to-do list using the
    Eisenhower Method of prioritization.</p>
<p>From <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method"
        target="_blank" class="link-body-emphasis">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<p>
    The "Eisenhower Method" or "Eisenhower Principle" is a method that utilizes
    the principles of importance and urgency to organize priorities and
    workload. This method stems from a quote attributed to Dwight D. Eisenhower:
    "I have two kinds of problems, the urgent and the important. The urgent are
    not important, and the important are never urgent." Eisenhower did not
    claim this insight for his own, but attributed it to an (unnamed) "former
    college president."
</p>
<p>
    Using the Eisenhower Decision Principle, tasks are evaluated using the
    criteria important/unimportant and urgent/not urgent, and then
    placed in according quadrants in an Eisenhower Matrix (also known as an
    "Eisenhower Box" or "Eisenhower Decision Matrix"). Tasks in the
    quadrants are then handled as follows.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Important/Urgent quadrant tasks are done immediately and personally,
        e.g. crises, deadlines, problems.
    </li>
    <li>Important/Not Urgent quadrant tasks get an end date and are done
        personally, e.g. relationships, planning, recreation.
    </li>
    <li>Unimportant/Urgent quadrant tasks are delegated, e.g. interruptions,
        meetings, activities.
    </li>
    <li>Unimportant/Not Urgent quadrant tasks are dropped, e.g. time wasters,
        pleasant activities, trivia.
    </li>
</ol>
