    <p>From <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method"
            target="_blank" class="link-body-emphasis">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
    <p>
        The "Eisenhower Method" or "Eisenhower Principle" is a method that
        utilizes the principles of importance and urgency to organize priorities
        and workload. This method stems from a quote attributed to Dwight D.
        Eisenhower: "I have two kinds of problems, the urgent and the important.
        The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent."
        Eisenhower did not claim this insight for his own, but attributed it to
        an (unnamed) "former college president."
    </p>
    <p>
        Using the Eisenhower Decision Principle, tasks are evaluated using the
        criteria important/unimportant and urgent/not urgent, and then
        placed in according quadrants in an Eisenhower Matrix (also known as an
        "Eisenhower Box" or "Eisenhower Decision Matrix"). Tasks in the
        quadrants are then handled as follows.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Important/Urgent quadrant tasks are done immediately and personally,
            e.g. crises, deadlines, problems.
        </li>
        <li>Important/Not Urgent quadrant tasks get an end date and are done
            personally, e.g. relationships, planning, recreation.
        </li>
        <li>Unimportant/Urgent quadrant tasks are delegated, e.g. interruptions,
            meetings, activities.
        </li>
        <li>Unimportant/Not Urgent quadrant tasks are dropped, e.g. time
            wasters, pleasant activities, trivia.
        </li>
    </ol>
