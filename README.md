# Eisenhower ToDo Management

## Overview

This application helps you to manage your to-do list using the Eisenhower Method
of prioritization.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method):

The "Eisenhower Method" or "Eisenhower Principle" is a method that utilizes the
principles of importance and urgency to organize priorities and workload. This
method stems from a quote attributed to Dwight D. Eisenhower: "I have two kinds
of problems, the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the
important are never urgent." Eisenhower did not claim this insight for his own,
but attributed it to an (unnamed) "former college president."

Using the Eisenhower Decision Principle, tasks are evaluated using the criteria
important/unimportant and urgent/not urgent, and then placed in according
quadrants in an Eisenhower Matrix (also known as an "Eisenhower Box" or "
Eisenhower Decision Matrix"). Tasks in the quadrants are then handled as
follows.

1. Important/Urgent quadrant tasks are done immediately and personally, e.g.
   crises, deadlines, problems.
2. Important/Not Urgent quadrant tasks get an end date and are done personally,
   e.g. relationships, planning, recreation.
3. Unimportant/Urgent quadrant tasks are delegated, e.g. interruptions,
   meetings, activities.
4. Unimportant/Not Urgent quadrant tasks are dropped, e.g. time wasters,
   pleasant activities, trivia.
